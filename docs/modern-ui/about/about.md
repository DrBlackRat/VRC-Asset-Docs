# ‚ú® About Modern UIs

**Modern UIs** is a collection of scripts, prefabs, and UI elements made to build clean, modern-looking UIs in VRChat. It‚Äôs built with a strong focus on animations and smooth interactions, so everything feels satisfying and responsive to use.

You might‚Äôve seen this system used in worlds like the [Furry Hideout](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_4b341546-65ff-4607-9d38-5b7f8f405132/info) or Golden Hour 2.

## üí≠ Why did I make this?

For the most part, I was just annoyed by the state of a lot of world UIs in VRChat and wanted to see if I could make something better.

Originally, this project only had a few different mirror UIs, but it‚Äôs grown a lot over time and now includes a bunch of different prefabs and scripts.
