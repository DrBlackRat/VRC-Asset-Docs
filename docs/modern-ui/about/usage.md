# ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

This page covers how to setup and use Modern UIs.

## Basics Setup

### üé® Commission

If you have a commissioned UI, you‚Äôll usually find everything inside the `Modern UIs (<Project Name>)` folder.

Inside that folder, there‚Äôs a demo scene that includes all the UIs you commissioned. You can either open that scene and copy everything into your own, or just grab the prefabs out of the `Prefabs` folder and drop them directly into your scene.

Once you‚Äôve added everything to your own scene, you‚Äôll need to link it all up. For that, follow the [Scripts](../scripts/) documentation.

If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to message me on Discord: **drblackrat**.

### üìÅ Standalone

If you got the standalone version, you will find everything inside the `Modern UIs` folder.

Inside that folder, there‚Äôs a demo scene that showcases close to everything you can do with Modern UIs. You can then either copy things you want out of that scene into your own, or just grab the prefabs out of the `Prefabs` folder and drop them directly into your scene.

Everything should be pretty self explanatory, but if you need more info check out [Scripts](../scripts/) and [Prefabs](../prefabs/) documentation. 

If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to message me on Discord: **drblackrat**.

## Adjusting UIs

If you want to adjust how certain UIs look or want to add more options to a Settings page please look at the corresponding [Scripts](../scripts/) and [Prefabs](../prefabs/) documentation.

In general things are easily adjustable, especially the main Tab UI. If you for example want to add another section or toggle just duplicate an already existing one and adjust it to your needs, Unity's Layout Components should take of adjusting everything.
